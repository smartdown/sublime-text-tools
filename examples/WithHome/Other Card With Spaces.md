# Testing Whether Spaces in Filenames Work

This file `Other Card With Spaces.md` is encoded with id `Other-Card-With-Spaces.md`, so that it can be referred to with Smartdown tunnel syntax:

```markdown
[](:@Other-Card-With-Spaces)
```


## Hypercube SVG Remotely

![](/media/hypercube)



## Hypercube SVG Locally

Because there is a `Home.md` in the same directory as this file, all of the `.md` and media files will be bundled. For example, the media file `Media With Spaces.svg` can be referred to with the syntax:

```markdown
![](/block/Media-With-Spaces.svg)
```

as below:

![](/block/Media-With-Spaces.svg)
